<h1>Count Digits</h1>

Given a number N. Count the number of digits in N which evenly divide N.

## Note :- 
Evenly divides means whether N is divisible by a digit i.e. leaves a remainder 0 when divided. 

## Example

## Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function evenlyDivides() which takes an integer N as input parameters and returns an integer, total number factor of digits N which divides N evenly.


**Expected Time Complexity:** O(log N) <br/>
**Expected Space Complexity:** O(1)
 

## Constraints:
1<=N<=105
