## Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function find_median() which takes the array as input parameter and return the floor value of the median.
 

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(n * log(n)) <br/>
**Expected Space Complexity:** O(1)
 
## Constraints:
1 <= Length of Array <= 100  <br/>
1 <= Elements of Array <= 100
