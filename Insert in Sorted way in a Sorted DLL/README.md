You only need to complete the function sortedInsert() that takes head reference and x as arguments and returns the head of the modified list. The printing and checking tasks are done by the driver code.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(n).  <br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1).

## Constraints:
1 <= Number of nodes <= 103
