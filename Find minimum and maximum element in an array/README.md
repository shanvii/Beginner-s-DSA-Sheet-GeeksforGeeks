## Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function getMinMax() which takes the array A[] and its size N as inputs and returns the minimum and maximum element of the array.


**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N) <br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

 
## Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= Ai <=1012
