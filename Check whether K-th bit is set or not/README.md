<h1> Check whether K-th bit is set or not </h1>

Given a number N and a bit number K, check if Kth index bit of N is set or not. A bit is called set if it is 1. Position of set bit '1' should be indexed starting with 0 from LSB side in binary representation of the number.
**Note:** Index is starting from 0. You just need to return true or false, driver code will take care of printing "Yes" and "No".

## Your task:
You don't have to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function checkKthbit that takes n and k as parameters and returns either true(if kth bit is set) or false(if kth bit is not set).

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(1). <br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1).

## Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 109 <br>
0 ≤ K ≤ 31
