## Your Task: 
You don't have to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function insert() and insertionSort() where insert() takes the array, it's size and an index i and insertionSort() uses insert function to sort the array in ascending order using insertion sort algorithm. 

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N*N). <br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1).

## Constraints:
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= arr[i] <= 1000
