<h1>Count type of Characters</h1>

Given a string S, write a program to count the occurrence of Lowercase characters, Uppercase characters, Special characters and Numeric values in the string.

## Note: 
There are no white spaces in the string.

## Example

## Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function count() which takes the string S as input and returns an array of size 4 where arr[0] = number of uppercase characters, arr[1] = number of lowercase characters, arr[2] = number of numeric characters and arr[3] = number of special characters.


**Expected Time Complexity:** O(|S|).  <br/>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1).


## Constraints:
1<=|S|<=105
