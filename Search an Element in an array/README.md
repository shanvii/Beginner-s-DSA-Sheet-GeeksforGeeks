## Your Task:
The task is to complete the function search() which takes the array arr[], its size N and the element X as inputs and returns the index of first occurrence of X in the given array. If the element X does not exist in the array, the function should return -1.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(n). <br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1). 

## Constraints:
1 <= n <= 106  <br>
0 <= arr[i] <= 106  <br>
0 <= x <= 105
