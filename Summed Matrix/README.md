<h1> Summed Matrix </h1>

A matrix is constructed of size n*n. such that Mi,j= i+j. Count the number of cells having value q.
Note: Assume, the array is in 1-based indexing.

 
## Example 1:

## Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function sumMatrix() which takes 2 Integers n, and q as input and returns the count of q in the n*n matrix.

 
**Expected Time Complexity:** O(1) <br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

 
## Constraints:
1 ≤ n,q ≤ 1018
