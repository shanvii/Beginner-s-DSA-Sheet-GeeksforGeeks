## Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function streamAvg() which takes the array of integers arr and n as input parameters and returns an array of type float denoting the average at every point in the stream. 

 
**Expected Time Complexity:** O(n)  <br/>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

 
## Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 105  <br/>
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 106
