<h1> Node at a given index in linked list </h1>

Given a singly linked list with N nodes and a number X. The task is to find the node at the given index (X)(1 based index) of linked list. 

## Input:
First line of input contains number of testcases T. For each testcase, first line of input contains space seperated two integers, length of linked list and X.

## Output:
For each testcase, there will be single line of output containing data at Xth node.

## User Task:
The task is to complete the function GetNth() which takes head reference and index as arguments and should return the data at Xth position in the linked list.

## Constraints:
1 <= T <= 30  <br>  
1 <= N <= 100  <br>
X <= N  <br>
1 <= value <= 103  <br>

## Example:
**Input:**  <br>
2  <br>
6 5  <br>
1 2 3 4 657 76  <br>
10 2  <br>
8 7 10 8 6 1 20 91 21 2  <br>

**Output:**  <br>
657  <br>
7

## Explanation:
**Testcase 1:** Element at 5th index in the linked list is 657 (1-based indexing).
