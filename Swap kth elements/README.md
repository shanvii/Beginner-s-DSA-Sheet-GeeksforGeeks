<h1>Swap kth elements</h1>

Given an array Arr of size N, swap the Kth element from beginning with Kth element from end.

## Example

## Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function swapKth() which takes the array of integers arr, n and k as parameters and returns void. You have to modify the array itself.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(1)  <br/>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

## Constraints:
1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 105  <br/>
1 ≤ Arr[i] ≤ 103
