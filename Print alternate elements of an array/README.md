<h1>Print alternate elements of an array</h1>

You are given an array A of size N. You need to print elements of A in alternate order (starting from index 0).

## Example

## Your Task:
Since this is a function problem, you just need to complete the provided function print() which takes A and n as input parameters and print the resultant array in the function itself. You have to print the final number of array ending with a space as Printing of newline character is taken care in driver code itself.

## Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105  <br/>
1 <= Ai <= 105

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(n)  <br/>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)
