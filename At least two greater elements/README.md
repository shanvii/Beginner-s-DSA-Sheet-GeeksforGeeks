<h1>At least two greater elements</h1>

Given an array of N distinct elements, the task is to find all elements in array except two greatest elements in sorted order.

## Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findElements() which takes the array A[] and its size N as inputs and return the vector sorted values denoting the elements in array which have at-least two greater elements than themselves.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N*Log(N))  <br/>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(N)

## Constraints:
3 ≤ N ≤ 105  <br/>
-106 ≤ Ai ≤ 106
