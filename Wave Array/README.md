<h1> Wave Array </h1>

Given a sorted array arr[] of distinct integers. Sort the array into a wave-like array(In Place).
In other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such that arr[1] >= arr[2] <= arr[3] >= arr[4] <= arr[5].....

If there are multiple solutions, find the lexicographically smallest one.

## Note:
The given array is sorted in ascending order, and you don't need to return anything to make changes in the original array itself.

## Example :

## Your Task:
The task is to complete the function convertToWave(), which converts the given array to a wave array.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(n). <br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1).

## Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 106 <br>
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤107
