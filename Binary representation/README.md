## Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function getBinaryRep() which takes an Integer N as input parameter and returns a string of size 30 which is the binary representation of N.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(LogN)  <br/>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

## Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9
