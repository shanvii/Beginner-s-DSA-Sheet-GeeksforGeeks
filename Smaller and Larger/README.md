<h1>Smaller and Larger</h1>

Given a sorted array Arr of size N and a value X, find the number of array elements less than or equal to X and elements more than or equal to X. 

## Example

## Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function getMoreAndLess() which takes the array of integers arr, n and x as parameters and returns an array of size 2. pair denoting the answer. The first value is number of elements less than or equal to x and the second value is number of elements more than or equal to x.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(logN)  <br/>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

## Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105  <br/>
0 ≤ X ≤ 106  <br/>
1 ≤ Arr[i] ≤ 106
