<h1>Count of smaller elements</h1>

Given an sorted array A of size N. Find number of elements which are less than or equal to given element X.

 
## Example

## Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function countOfElements() which takes the array A[], its size N and an integer X as inputs and returns the number of elements which are less than or equal to given element.

 
**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N)  <br/>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

 
## Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105  <br/>
1 <= Ai <= 105  <br/>
0 <= X <= 105
