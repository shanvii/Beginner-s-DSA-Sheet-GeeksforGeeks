## Your Task:
This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function printNos() that takes N as parameter and prints number from 1 to N recursively. Don't print newline, it will be added by the driver code.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N).  <br/>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(N) (Recursive).

## Constraints:
1 <= N <= 1000
