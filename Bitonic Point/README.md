<h1> Bitonic Point </h1>

Given an array arr of n elements that is first strictly increasing and then maybe strictly decreasing, find the maximum element in the array.

## Note: 
If the array is increasing then just print the last element will be the maximum value.

## EXAMPLE:

## Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findMaximum() which takes the array arr[], and n as parameters and returns an integer denoting the answer.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(logn) <br>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

## Constraints:
3 ≤ n ≤ 106
1 ≤ arri ≤ 106
