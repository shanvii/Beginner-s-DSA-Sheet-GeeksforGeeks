<h1>Fascinating Number</h1>

Given a number N. Your task is to check whether it is fascinating or not.  <br/>

### Fascinating Number: 
When a number(should contain 3 digits or more) is multiplied by 2 and 3, and when both these products are concatenated with the original number, then it results in all digits from 1 to 9 present exactly once.

## Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function fascinating() which takes the integer n parameters and returns boolean(True or False) denoting the answer.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(1)  <br/>
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

## Constraints:
100 <= N <= 2*109
